# Data Engineering and AWS-Projects

###### You can find my AWS projects along with their architectures and a step-by-step explanation of my reasoning behind them. I want to clarify that these projects were developed after extensive research and following guides. I have added detailed notes and explanations to aid my own learning.




## Title: Real-Time Stock Market Data Engineering using Apache Kafka and AWS

Summary: In this project, we set up an end-to-end data engineering pipeline to collect and process real-time stock market data using Apache Kafka and AWS services such as Glue, Athena, and S3. We created a Kafka topic, produced and consumed data using Python, and stored the data in an S3 bucket. Then, we used Glue Crawler to crawl and create a table in Athena for querying and analysis. This project demonstrates how to use Kafka and AWS services to build a real-time data processing pipeline for stock market data.
